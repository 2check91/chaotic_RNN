# Chaotic Recurrent Neural Networks
Implementation of RNN model described in "Generating Coherent Patterns of Activity from Chaotic Neural Networks" (David Sussillo and L. F. Abbott, 2009, http://www.theswartzfoundation.org/docs/Sussillo-Abbott-Coherent-Patterns-August-2009.pdf)

**filtered_data.mat** is obtained from VRep Robotics simulator (Asimo robot). Smoothing using moving average filter was applied to data.
